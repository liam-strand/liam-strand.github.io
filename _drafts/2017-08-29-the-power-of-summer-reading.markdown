Summer reading is a useful tool to help prevent the summer slide, but only if the books chosen are engaging and interesting. I (like anyone else) love a good book, but often have trouble finding books that I enjoy. Summer reading can be an avenue to discover new books, or even entire new genres of books that are fun to read and make students think about their experiences. Summer reading assignments can only be effective if students actually read the books, and that is much more likely if they have a choice in the reading. However, having an entire class read the same book can benefit conversation and discussion in class and gives all the students a baseline perspective from which to view course material. It can be helpful (at least for me) for course material and themes to be connected back to literature that I’ve read. Having a book that everyone has read makes it much easier for a teacher to make those connections.

For the reasons outlined above: I believe that it is good to have both a choice book (selected from three or four options) and one mandatory book for summer reading. My summer reading this year was a choice from Never Caught, Killer Angels, and Hidden Figures. I chose Killer Angels because I didn’t know very much about the Civil War, and I hoped that Killer Angels would serve to educate me on what was going on in the most decisive battle in the entire war. Killer Angels did, in fact, greatly educate me on the specifics of how the war was fought, and how people on both sides viewed the war. My mandatory book was The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes. I found this collection absolutely fascinating. It covered topics from racism to patriotism and told stories that were both hilarious and heartbreaking.

My favorite poem in the collection was Freedom’s Plow. It is a call for unity and resilience against prejudice and injustice. It begins by telling the story of how a generic community comes to be and how communities can share (and build) the same dream. The poem then connects that idea of the shared dream to the first diverse immigrants to America and how they all had the same dream; freedom. Freedom’s Plow then shifts its focus to three great quotes: “ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL – ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS – AMONG THESE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS” (Jefferson), “NO MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH TO GOVERN ANOTHER MAN WITHOUT THAT OTHER’S CONSENT” (Lincoln), and “BETTER TO DIE FREE THAN TO LIVE SLAVES” (Frederick Douglass). These three quotes illustrate the power of demanding one’s dream, demanding freedom. The perspective of African Americans is included between each of these quotes. The resounding theme between them is hope that someday things will change for them. Hope is the most powerful emotion. It brought an end to the systematic segregation of The South, it healed the United States after 9/11, and it won Barack Obama his presidency. The poem concludes by explaining that “America is a dream” (Langston Hughes, 295), and that we all play a role in creating, maintaining, and hoping for that dream.

I would have never found Freedom’s Plow without summer reading. I would never have had that deeply personal experience of patriotism. Not patriotism as in American nationalism, but patriotism as love for the idea of America. Little moments of connection and emotion (like this) don’t happen if people don’t read new books.

Summer reading shouldn’t be difficult, it should be an opportunity to explore ourselves or understand others at the students’ own pace. There doesn’t need to be a big rush, there’s no need for annotation. All that should happen is that the student reads. To test for completion of the summer reading assignment, all that should be asked is: “How and why did this book change you, or why didn’t it?” because that’s the goal, isn’t it? To get a student to read something that has a lasting impact.
