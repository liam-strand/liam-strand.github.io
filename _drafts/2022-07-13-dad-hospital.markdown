There are many theories as to why Dad's heart rate slowed, the prevailing being [Lyme Carditis](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/treatment/lymecarditis.html), based on various symptoms that Dad has experienced over the last two months. Dad was given IV antibiotics, and Lyme tests were done. His Lyme results were negative, and the antibiotics did not have an effect. Although not 100% definitive, this indicates that Lyme Carditis is not the likely culprit.

Truthfully, the cardiac team has not figured out why Dad's heart beat slowed down. One working theory is that Dad has [cardiac sarcoidosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350358#:~:text=Sarcoidosis%20is%20a%20disease%20characterized,skin,%20heart%20and%20other%20organs). This may be true, but if so, it is odd that Dad has no symptoms other than slow heart rate. What is clear, however, is that it makes sense for Dad to have a more permanent pacemaker inserted for his safety.
