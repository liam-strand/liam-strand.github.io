Mom and Liam having gone home very late the night before were competely exhausted, een whe they woke up.There are many theories as to why Dad's heart rate slowed, the prevailing being [Lyme Carditis](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/treatment/lymecarditis.html),based on various symptoms Dad has experienced over the last two months. Dad already had numerous IV lines set up, which made it easy to contineue the antibiotics started the previous night. 

Lyme tests were done. But unfortunately, the Lyme results were negative. THe antibiotics were not having an effect at that time, but everyone thought that it would be a good idea to continue the so long as he was in the hospital. antibiotics did not have an effect. Although not 100% definitive, this indicates that Lyme Carditis is not the likely culprit.

Mom has continued to convince the infectious disease team and the cardiac team that Dad should continue to be treated with antibiotics, even though Lyme is negative, as it is possible that Dad may be infected, but is testing negative due to a weak antibody response. Mom remembered that this is what happened when Dad had Lyme back in 2015.

Truthfully, the cardiac team has not figured out why Dad's heart beat slowed down. One working theory is that Dad has [cardiac sarcoidosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350358#:~:text=Sarcoidosis%20is%20a%20disease%20characterized,skin,%20heart%20and%20other%20organs). This may be true, but if so, it is odd that Dad has no symptoms other than slow heart rate. What is clear, however, is that it makes sense for Dad to have a more permanent pacemaker installed for his safety.
