There are many theories as to why Dad's heart rate slowed, the prevailing being [Lyme Carditis](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/treatment/lymecarditis.html), based on various symptoms that Dad has experienced over the last two months. Dad was given IV antibiotics, and Lyme tests were done. His Lyme results were negative, and the antibiotics have not had an effect. Although not 100% definitive, this indicates that Lyme Carditis is not the likely culprit.

Mom has continued to convince the infectious disease team and the cardiac team that Dad should continue to be treated with antibiotics, even though Lyme is negative, as it is possible that Dad may be infected, but is testing negative due to a weak antibody response. Mom remembered that this is what happened when Dad had Lyme back in 2015.

Truthfully, the cardiac team has not figured out why Dad's heart beat slowed down. One working theory is that Dad has [cardiac sarcoidosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350358#:~:text=Sarcoidosis%20is%20a%20disease%20characterized,skin,%20heart%20and%20other%20organs). This may be true, but if so, it is odd that Dad has no symptoms other than slow heart rate. What is clear, however, is that it makes sense for Dad to have a more permanent pacemaker installed for his safety.
