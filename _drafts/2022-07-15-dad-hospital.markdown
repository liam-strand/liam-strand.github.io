This morning has been a nightmare. They reversed themselves on the procedure. We have been in a battle all morning with the Massachusetts General Hospital machine to try to get them to put in the pacemaker prior to doing the mediastinoscopy. 

Bottom line, putting in the more complicated pacemaker without a specific diagnosis violates “standard of care“. Translation: insurance. This is despite the head of cardiothoracic surgery telling Brad this morning that he thought placing the pacemaker first was a smarter, safer, better approach. When Brad shared this with a cardiologist, however, the cardiologist became very upset/irate, called in the head of cardiothoracic surgery, and chastised him in front of Brad, with me on speaker phone. The surgeon immediately backed away and eventually left saying that “cardiology had to figure out what they wanted to have happen.”

Hours of conversations later, including untold twists and turns, and multiple warnings/suggestions which implied that it’s on us if Brad has a heart attack and dies, we are now at the point where Brad will have a pacemaker implanted today, but not the one with a built-in defibrillator. I should say, this is what we believe is going to happen, we have been told is going to happen, But also something that they can decide will not happen.
