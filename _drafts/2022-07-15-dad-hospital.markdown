This morning was a nightmare. The “primary team” reversed themselves on the procedure. Mom was in discussion (battle) all morning with the Massachusetts General Hospital machine to try to get them to put in the pacemaker prior to doing a mediastinoscopy.

Bottom line, putting in the more complicated pacemaker without a specific diagnosis violates “standard of care“. (Translation: insurance.) This, despite the head of cardiothoracic surgery telling Dad this morning that he thought placing the pacemaker first was a smarter, safer, better approach. When Dad shared this information with a cardiologist, however, the cardiologist became very upset, called in the head of cardiothoracic surgery, and chastised him in front of Dad, with Mom on speaker phone. The surgeon immediately backed away and eventually left saying that “cardiology had to figure out what they wanted to have happen.”

Hours of conversations later, including untold twists and turns, and multiple warnings/suggestions which implied that it’s on us if Dad has a heart attack and dies, we are now at the point where Dad will have a pacemaker implanted in the afternoon, but not the one with a built-in defibrillator. Kristina feels as though she had a glimpse into what technical negotiations look like behind closed doors at Google. Despite being literally tethered to a bed with a wire in his heart, Dad showed remarkable restraint in these discussions. And, mom used her trademark charm and pursuasiveness to finagle this outcome. The two of them bounced off of one another in the conversations each of us providing different information, was the best switching back-and-forth between “pushy“ and submissive.

A pulmonary specialists showed up today, fully unaware of today’s plan. As we continue to experience, each specialist has a different priority, and their treatments/approaches are often in conflict. One thing that everyone seems to agree on though, is that Dad‘s body is in remarkable shape.

Mom has done a remarkable job keeping everyone's stories straight and informing each successive doctor of what the previous doctors have said. Furthermore, she has done a great job of holding the doctors acountable when they renage on their plans. This has been an especially challenging day for all three of us, especially for Mom, as she has been trying to resolve many of the communication challenges.

As multiple friend doctors have said, the priority should be to do is to get the pacemaker placed, get Dad out of the hospital, and move on from there. Fortunately, Dad is now prepped for the pacemaker, so it seems that is going forward this afternoon!
