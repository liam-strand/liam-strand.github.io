As the gurney approached to take Dad away to the pacemaker surgery late last night, a pulmonologist jumped in the room to talk to us one last time about not doing the pacemaker surgery. The pulmonologist said that there was another type of lymph node biopsy that could be performed instead of the mediastinoscopy, called a endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). Instead of going through the meat of his chest to extract lymph nodes, they can go down his throat with a special tool that can go into his lungs and a tiny little needle. They can use the needle to take a sample of the lymph nodes near his heart and lungs, without having to cut through the "high value real estate" near his lungs and heart.

Of course, all of this new information came at an extremely inoportune time, as the transport team was waiting outside Dad's room. Mom expertly provided the pulmonologist with a synopsis of the situation, including our frustration with the constantly changing plans and the discomfort dad was feeling, being stuck in bed.

The pulmonologist was wonderfully understanding, and explained the risks associated with having Dad leave the hospital without addaquite treatment, and the risks of the two types of biopsy. The [mediastinoscopy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534863/) has an overall mortality rate of 0.09%, it's a very serious procedure. In comparison, the [EBUS-TBNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367563/) has an extremely low overall mortality rate.

All of this was very new information to us, and we would have loved to talk to the pulmonologist about it, but we were not able to because we needed to decide weather or not to give up Dad's surgery spot so that someone else could use it. Mom expertly guided our internal discussion, and we agreed to not do the pacemaker surgery, and to do the EBUS-TBNA on Monday instead. Mom did an amazing job of explaining how important it is to us that this plan not change on Monday, and that we actually go through with it.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mom spent a lot of time at the hospital keeping Dad company and maintaining his mental health. Other than being kept in bed, Dad is very comfortable.
