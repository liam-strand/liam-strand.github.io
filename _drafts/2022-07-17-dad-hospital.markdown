As the gurney approached to take Dad away to the pacemaker surgery late last night, a pulmonologist jumped in the room to talk to us one last time about not doing the pacemaker surgery. The pulmonologist said that there was another type of lymph node biopsy that could be performed instead of the mediastinoscopy. Instead of going through the meat of his chest to extract lymph nodes, they can go down his throat with a special tool that can go into his lungs and a tiny little needle. They can use the needle to take a sample of the lymph nodes near his heart and lungs, without having to cut through the "high value real estate" near his lungs and heart.

Of course, all of this new information came at an extremely inoportune time.
