Dadâ€™s surgery for the biopsy is scheduled to take place at 12:45. He will be fully sedated and intubated. They expect the surgery to take approximately one hour, and the recovery to take 1 to 2 hours.  

I will be in the waiting room. They will let me know how things are going. I have asked them to please let me go and sit by him in the recovery room. I do not know if this will be allowed. I will let you guys know via text when I know anything.
