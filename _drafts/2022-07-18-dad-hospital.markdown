Because of the planned biopsy, Dad was unable to eat for the entire morning, and much of the afternoon. Although the procedure was scheduled to take place around 12:45, it ended up being pushed back to 3:47. One of the challenges of being in such a large institution is that there are specialists for every procedure. So, it is hard to keep lines of communication open between members of the "care team".

Dadâ€™s surgery for the biopsy was scheduled to take place at 12:45, but it actually started at 3:47. After asking all the relevant and important questions about risks and safety, Dad went to the operating room and Mom went to the waiting area.

During the surgery, I landed in Boston and, after a pit-stop at my apartment, I went to the hospital to join Mom in the waiting area.

During the operation, Mom continued to communicate with various apartement systems to figure out the best place to stay.
