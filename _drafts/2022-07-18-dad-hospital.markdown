Because of the planned biopsy, Dad was unable to eat for the entire morning, and much of the afternoon. Although the procedure was scheduled to take place around 12:45, it ended up being pushed back to 3:47. One of the challenges of being in such a large institution is that there are specialists for every procedure. So, it is hard to keep lines of communication open between members of the "care team".

Dadâ€™s surgery for the biopsy was scheduled to take place at 12:45, but it actually started at 3:47. After asking all the relevant and important questions about risks and safety, Dad went to the operating room and Mom went to the waiting area.

Immidiately before the opertaion, I landed in Boston and, after a pit-stop at my apartment, I went to the hospital to join Mom in the waiting area, while Mom continued to communicate with various apartement systems to figure out the best place to stay. 

At 5:15, the procedure ended, and the surgery team gave Mom a call to let us know that it went well. It turns out that the person who performed the biopsy was on the team who invented the EBUS-TBNA procedure! They captured samples of the 4L, 7, and 11R lymph nodes (see figure 4 of [this paper](/assets/docs/EBUS-TBNA.pdf)).

Unfortunately, the nurses in the ansthesia recovery room refused to allow us to see him. The transit team (also with the ansthesia team) forced us out of his room in the cardiology department when he returned; a very disappointing experience in. We eventually were able to return to his room, and Dad was no worse for wear, other than a sore throat.

Later that night, the EBUS-TBNA doctor came up to Dad's room to talk to us about how the procedure went. He was excited to talk about the medical devices that were used and how he navigated through Dad's pulminary system. This meeting was also when he pointed us to the [two](/assets/docs/EBUS-TBNA.pdf) [papers](/assets/docs/EBUS-TBNA-case-study.pdf) that have shown up in this and previous posts.

Mom and the doctor immidiately hit it off.
