Free Voluntary Reading is one of the most spectacularly amazing things that has ever been included in an English class. It allows me to take twenty minutes out of my day to sit down and read, something that (although I’d love to) I’d never do otherwise during the school year.

At the beginning of the school year, I was reading a book called New York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson, a science-fiction-dystopian-utopian novel about the effect of climate change and sea level rise on the city of New York. It is, however, extremely long and has a plot that really doesn’t need 600 pages. So, I’m dropping it on page 90 in exchange for What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton, her memoir about the 2016 election. I’ve never read a memoir before, but I’ve chosen this one because I really want to know what she was thinking and doing during the election, and how she gets up in the morning now that she’s lost and we’ve got Trump screwing around in the Oval Office.

Without FVR, I would have wasted much more time getting to page 90 in New York 2140 before putting the book down. FVR makes it possible for me to try new books faster, and invest less time in books that I don’t like. This is because I find out if I dislike a book much sooner due to the added reading time. Without FVR, I could easily spend a month just getting through the introduction of the book, and not get to the real plot until I’ve already invested a month into the book.

I went to public school through the third grade. My teacher was awful, and the lessons were incredibly boring. I’d usually get through my class work in a couple of hours then I’d flip my hood up and spend the rest of the day reading. Using this system, I was able to read the entire Harry Potter series five times in one year. Not only did I read the Harry Potter series, but I also read many other (more difficult) forms of literature like Tintin (this isn’t difficult reading, but it did introduce me to the concept of racism and stereotyping), The Little House on the Prairie (this actually has some difficult language, so it forced me to expand my vocabulary), and countless nonfiction books. By simply reading huge amounts of material, I was able to reach a seventh grade reading level in third grade. I couldn’t write well at all (because I was never asked to write), but I could read very well. My reading ability didn’t only help me in English, it also helped in history (a reading-heavy class). FVR provides an opportunity to read, and in my experience, reading is the best way to get better at reading.

With teacher support, this could work even better. If the teacher were to help students select a book that is both fun to read (interests the student) and has some difficult vocabulary, then the student would both have fun and become a better reader.

Voluntary reading is also a wonderful stress reliever in a way that assigned reading isn’t. It allows me to escape into another world (or someone else’s world) and forget about the business and hecticity of life at school. A [study](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5070874/Reading-can-help-reduce-stress.html) done by the University of Sussex in 2009 showed that reading for as few as six minutes can reduce stress in significant, measurable ways. I wholeheartedly agree with the findings of this study (on an anecdotal level). I’ve always enjoyed reading, so I find reading to be peaceful and relaxing. However, many people ‘hate’ reading. For these people, reading might not be relaxing, but stressful. I firmly believe that people who ‘hate’ reading just haven’t found the right book yet, and with guidance, they could learn to love reading.

I love to read. But during the school year, voluntary reading often falls by the wayside due to the multiple commitments that infringe on time that would otherwise be spent reading. FVR makes it possible to reclaim some of that time.

Although it can infringe on class time, Free Voluntary Reading is critical for the mental health and reading ability of students, and should not be removed in favor of more traditional classroom learning.
