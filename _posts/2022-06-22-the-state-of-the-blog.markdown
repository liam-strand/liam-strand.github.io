Hi Everyone, welcome to my blog/website/dumping ground for old stuff that I think is fun! I maintained a blog in high school, and when it was shut down, I migrated the posts here. Most of them are focused on literature (it was a part of my English class), but I really enjoyed writing for it and I think that the posts are worth keeping around.

Those posts are from my time at Sacred Heart. Now I am a rising junior studying Computer Science at the Tufts School of Engineering, so Tthe content of the blog will likely change to focus on my current work. But, who knows, maybe some literature or theatre will pop up at some point! 

I hope you enjoy your time here, feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-strand), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiamStrand/featured), or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/liam_itchy_dad) accounts.
