Brad noticed a high heart rate earlier this year. It stabilized with no intervention. Starting on July 6th, however, Brad has experienced [Bradycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/bradycardia--slow-heart-rate#:~:text=Bradycardia%20is%20a%20heart%20rate,But%20there%20are%20exceptions), but with no other significant symptoms of any kind. On Tuesday, we were able to get an appointment at Nantucket Urgent Care. They immediately sent him to the Emergency Room. There, despite a consistent 98% blood/oxygen reading, and stable blood pressure, they determined that Brad should be Medivaced to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). I flew with him, and they began doing tests as soon as we arrived. 

It was determined based on Brad’s EKGs and heart rate, that he has a [heart block](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-block/#:~:text=Heart%20block%20is%20a%20condition,control%20how%20your%20heart%20beats). As MGH is a teaching hospital, every conclusion has involved an astoundingly large number of physicians/decision makers (perhaps 20 at a time), as well as nurses, who make a myriad of tactical decisions throughout the day. Adding to the decision-making cacophony, is the fact that the entire group rotates every 10 hours or so, and that most if not all of the physicians have the authority to alter medications, etc. essentially at any time.

Concern over the possibility of Brad’s heart stopping, led to a (large group) decision to place a temporary pacing wire to serve as a “temporary pacemaker”, specifically to ensure that Brad’s heart not stop. The wire was strung through Brad's jugular vein Tuesday night and began sending regular electrical impulses immediately to keep Brad's heart rate at 60. The intent was/is to keep Brad safe while they attempted to determine the root cause of what’s going on.
