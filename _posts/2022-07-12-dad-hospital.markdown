Dad noticed a high heart rate earlier this year. It stabilized with no intervention. Starting on July 6th, however, Dad has experienced [bradycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/bradycardia--slow-heart-rate#:~:text=Bradycardia%20is%20a%20heart%20rate,But%20there%20are%20exceptions), but with no other significant symptoms of any kind. On Tuesday, Mom was able to get an appointment at Nantucket Urgent Care. They immediately sent him to the Emergency Room. There, despite a consistent 98% blood/oxygen reading, and stable blood pressure, they determined that Dad should be medivaced to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Mom, even though she is terrified of helicopters,  convinced the pilots to allower her to fly with him, and they began doing tests  as soon as they arrived. Liam met up with Mom and Dad at MGH later in the evening.

It was determined based on Dad's EKGs and heart rate, that he has a [heart block](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-block/#:~:text=Heart%20block%20is%20a%20condition,control%20how%20your%20heart%20beats). As MGH is a teaching hospital, every conclusion has involved an astoundingly large number of physicians/decision makers (perhaps 20 at a time), as well as nurses, who make a myriad of tactical decisions throughout the day. Adding to the decision-making cacophony, is the fact that the entire group rotates every 10 hours or so, and that most if not all of the physicians have the authority to alter medications, etc. essentially at any time.

Mom was instrumental in making sure each successive doctor or nurse was aware of what the previous doctor or nurse had suggested, said, or done. 

Concern over the possibility of Dad's heart stopping, led to a (large group) decision to place a temporary pacing wire to serve as a “temporary pacemaker”, specifically to ensure that Dad's heart would not stop. The wire was strung through Dad's jugular vein Tuesday night and began sending regular electrical impulses immediately to keep Dad's heart rate at 60. The intent was/is to keep Dad safe while they attempt to determine the root cause of what’s going on.

Unfortunately, the presence of the wire prevents Dad from getting a heart MRI, which whould have been extremely helpful in determining the root cause of the heart block. One of the doctors who saw Dad at the beginning of the adventure noted this, and, although Mom reminded the subsequent groups of doctors of this, they decided that the risk of Dad's heart stopping was too great to allow him to sleep through the night without the wire to get the MRI in the morning.

One other unfortunate byproduct of the temp wire is that it prevents Dad from getting out of bed, as there is a risk that the wire will move in a dangerous way.
