Dad is in the Cardiac Step-Down Unit at Mass General in Boston with a complete heart block. It’s kind of miraculous that he was able to function as well as he did.

Currently, Dad is wired up to many devices so cannot get out of bed. They strung a wire through his jugular last night to serve as a “temporary pacemaker” to make sure his heart doesn’t stop. It sends regular electrical impulses to keep his heart rate at 60. This is to keep him safe while they determine the root cause of what’s going on. 

In her research, my mom learned about Lyme Carditis. She also pulled together a timeline of events. The doctors looked at it carefully both at the Nantucket Cottage Hospital and at MGH. Their current thinking is that think this is a result of undiagnosed Lyme that developed into Lyme carditis.

They’ve taken an enormous amount of blood from Dad, and are doing lots of tests. He’s on IV antibiotics for Lyme already, although we won’t learn the Lyme results probably until tomorrow. 

The residents were pushing last night to make plans to insert a pacemaker today. I’m trying to get them to slow down, at least talk to us before doing that.

This morning, someone came into his room and wanted to give him blood thinners. He told them no, which is good because it further complicates everything. They did an ultrasound of his heart today at 7:45AM also.
