We thought we were on a straightforward path until one of the cardiologists decided at 7:30pm that he wanted to try to determine whether Brad has sarcoidosis, by having lymph nodes in the middle of Brad's chest biposied prior to implanting the pacemaker. The cardiologist said this could be done at the same time the pacemaker was placed, and started the process in motion, which involved sending in a cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss the procedure, its risks, and the timeline, and to obtain our consent.

As we discussed the process, we learned that it involved at a minimum doing a [mediastinoscopy](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/mediastinoscopy), a non-trivial procedure which would likely forestall placement of the pacemaker until at least Monday, particularly since there is no room on the surgery docket to do the mediastinoscopy on Friday. The cardiothoracic surgeon also said that Brad would likely wait all day and not end up having the procedure performed, or have results available until Monday or Tuesday. She additionally informed us that the mediastinoscopy is performed would be at a different time and place from the pacemaker placement, by a different team, and involve complete sedation, with Brad only having a temporary pacemaker wire guarding his heart. 

After discussing pros and cons of doing a mediastinoscopy, and running our thoughts by two additional doctors, we decided to plan for Brad to have a [biventricular pacemaker](https://www.nm.org/conditions-and-care-areas/treatments/biventricular-pacemaker) placed tomorrow (Friday), and forego the mediastinoscopy for the moment. Truth be told, implanting a pacemaker is not a difficult procedure. It does not involve full sedation, and usually results in the patient going home that or the following day.

So, assuming all goes as planned, Brad will have a pacemaker inserted tomorrow, and likely be discharged Saturday. Meanwhile, Liam and I will tour three (small) apartments across from Google’s Cambridge offices, and select one to rent for the short term. This will allow Brad to ease into work, while we and the MGH team try to determine what more needs to be done if anything.

Thank you everyone for your support, and my apologies again to those whom I have “left hanging”.
