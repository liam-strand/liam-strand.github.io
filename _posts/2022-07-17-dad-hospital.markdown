As the gurney approached to take Dad away to the pacemaker surgery late Friday evening, a pulmonologist jumped in the room to talk to us one last time about not doing the pacemaker surgery. The pulmonologist said that there was another type of lymph node biopsy that could be performed instead of the mediastinoscopy, called a endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ([EBUS-TBNA](/assets/docs/EBUS-TBNA.pdf)). Instead of going through the meat of his chest to extract lymph nodes, they can go down his throat with a special tool that can go into his lungs and a tiny little needle. They can use the needle to take a sample of the lymph nodes near his heart and lungs, without having to cut through the "high value real estate" near his lungs and heart.

Of course, all of this new information came at an extremely inconvenient time, as the transport team was waiting outside Dad's room. Mom expertly provided the pulmonologist with a synopsis of the situation, including our frustration with the constantly changing plans and the discomfort dad was feeling, being stuck in bed.

The pulmonologist was wonderfully understanding, and explained the risks associated with having Dad leave the hospital without addaquite treatment, and the risks of the two types of biopsy. The mediastinoscopy has an overall mortality rate of [0.09%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534863/), it's a very serious procedure. In comparison, the EBUS-TBNA has a [negligable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367563/) overall mortality rate.

All of this was very new information to us, and we would have loved to talk at length to the pulmonologist about it, but we were not able to because we needed to decide weather or not to give up Dad's surgery spot so that someone else could use it. Mom expertly guided our internal discussion, and got additional informtation from the pulminologist, cardiologist, and internal-medecine doctors. In the end, we agreed to not do the pacemaker surgery, and to do the EBUS-TBNA on Monday instead. Mom did an amazing job of explaining how important it is to us that this plan not change on Monday, and that we actually go through with it.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mom spent a lot of time at the hospital keeping Dad company and maintaining his mental health. She even got him moved to a bed near the window, which was very nice as it allowed Dad to see the massive scale of the hospital, and to get some sun.

On another note, Mom had the idea to send me to Nantucket to pick up some items that were going to be needed for a longish-term stay in Boston, and to take care of buttoning up the house. Since Mom and Dad left so suddenly on Tuesday, the house was not in a stable state (dirty clothes, dishes, perishable food, etc.), and Bela needed a check-in to make sure everything was in order with her.

Julia came along with me to help out and to provide moral support. They ended up returning to Boston on Monday, after the usual travel complications, complete with phone-calls to JetBlue and Cape Air.
