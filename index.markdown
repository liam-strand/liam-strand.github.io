Welcome!

This is a repository for a few migrated posts from an old blog, along with links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-strand), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiamStrand/featured), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/liam_itchy_dad) accounts where you will find samples of some of my recent and past work, and interests.

A little about me:

I am a junior studying computer science at the Tufts School of Engineering. I love taking complex problems that I donâ€™t know how to solve, and breaking them down into solvable pieces that allow me to create elegant solutions.  Sometimes this also involves looking for pre-existing knowledge and solutions, identifying and developing needed new skills, and writing and deleting lots of bad code to identify incorrect solutions before the great solution becomes evident. I enjoy delving into every part of this process, including learning new problem-solving approaches, discovering new tools, and learning new languages. Early on, I became enamored with Erlang, I am however doing most of my work in Python and C++, and dabbling in Rust and TypeScript.

Outside of my life as a developing engineer, I relish time with my friends and also split my time between family homes on the East and West coasts, where I am often coerced into home repair projects. I love to read, although I do not have nearly enough time to make a dent in my giant pile of books. I also enjoy hiking and working out with my friends, doing nearly anything on the water, singing in a concert choir, and being a reader/judge for a short play festival. Last but definitely not least, I get tremendous pleasure from baking and cooking with others, and from hanging out with Bela, my wonderful but unpredictable dog.
