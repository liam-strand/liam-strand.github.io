Welcome!

This is a repository for a few migrated posts from an old blog, along with links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-strand), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiamStrand/featured), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/liam_itchy_dad), and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33756154-liam-strand) accounts where you will find samples of some of my past work and interests.

A little about me:

I am a first-year Masters student studying computer science at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. I love taking complex problems that I don’t know how to solve, and breaking them down into solvable pieces that allow me to create elegant solutions. Sometimes this also involves looking for pre-existing knowledge and solutions, identifying and developing needed new skills, and writing and deleting lots of bad code to identify incorrect solutions before the great solution becomes evident. I enjoy delving into every part of this process, including learning new problem-solving approaches, discovering new tools, and learning new languages.

Most of my work these days is focused on developing software systems that take advantage of hardware to improve performance, efficency, accuracy, and security. I love C and Rust (C++ less so) as much as the next systems programmer, but it's always fun to get down and dirty in RISC-V assembly and Chisel.

Outside of my life as a developing engineer, I relish time with my friends and also split my time between family homes on the East and West coasts, where I am often coerced into home repair projects. I love to read, although I do not have nearly enough time to make a dent in my giant pile of books. I also enjoy hiking and working out with my friends, doing nearly anything on the water, playing piano, and being a reader/judge for a short play festival. Last but definitely not least, I get tremendous pleasure from baking and cooking with others, and from hanging out with Bela, my wonderful but unpredictable dog.

Email is always the best way to get in touch, please feel free to reach out!

Liam
